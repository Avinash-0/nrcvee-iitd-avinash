    <p>The NRCVEE approach towards imparting value-based education is based on first person experience and understanding. 
        It aims to bring about a change in individuals by bringing about a change in the individuals thinking process. Just as
        the scientists like to carry out rigorous experimentations before accepting a proposed theory to explain observable
        phenomenon in nature, NRCVEE aims to bring about changes that are grounded in rigorous experimentation, analysis and
        contemplation. We offer many programs and courses to meet this objective. We invite you to come with the open and unprejudiced
        mind of a scientist, experience our programs and courses, carry out experimentations in your own lab
        (i.e. your own mind-body-complex) and draw your own conclusions. You may discover something so new and so
        interesting that you may wonder why you didnt explore this earlier!
        Focus Areas of NRCVEE have been identified to facilitate this exhilarating journey into your own inner space !
