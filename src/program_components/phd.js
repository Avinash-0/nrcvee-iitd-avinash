        <h2>Background</h2>
        <div className='background_content'>
        <p>After protracted discussions spread over two years, the BERP has in principle agreed that the Centre could start a Ph.D. programme after due approval from the Board of PG Studies and Senate.  A proposal for the same is being prepared and would be placed in the formal channel for approval.   Once this programme is formally approved, it would open up avenues for a larger number of faculty members across IIT Delhi to take interest in the activities of NRCVEE.    It would also help the centre in enriching the variety and number of programmes it is able to organize for the institute community. NRCVEE offers very strong full-time as well as part-time PhD program for people interested in pursuing these areas.
        
        For more details about our PhD program, please contact Prof. Rahul Garg</p>
        <h2>Research Activity</h2>
        <p>
        Since its inception, NRCVEE has been actively involved in various research activities. The NRCVEE review committee appreciated the novel research being undertaken at the centre. Further , the committee strongly recommended that NRCVEE should build infrastructure and research facilities that can support its research activities. It recognised the potential of the centre for multidisciplinary research on the topics relevant to the current needs of the society.
        </p>
        <p>
        NRCVEE till date has graduated four PhD students. These students have presented their research papers at various National and International forums as well as published in several International journals of repute (Appendix 4). The research studies cover multiple disciplines- philosophy, sociology, psychology, and neuroscience to produce rich research insights. The investigations include socially relevant topics such as; sustainability and leadership, Value education in the Tertiary education systems, Neurocognitive effects of Human- Nature connection and the effects of Spiritual practices on Mental health. The research activities of the centre have received considerable attention in the popular media (Appendix 5) and have been widely circulated on the social media platforms as well.

        </p>
        <p>
        Currently, there are four part-time and six full-time PhD students enrolled in the centre investigating wide-ranging research topics. In line with the research focus of the centre and the
recommendation by the review committee the number of PhD students are projected to increase upto 20 each in full-time and part-time for the next five years.
Apart from the PhD research, two externally funded projects are being undertaken by the centre. During the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, the centre felt the urgent need for research to examine the efficacy of indigineous ways namely; yoga and naturopathy in combating COVID 19 related mental and physical health issues. Subsequently, recognising its social responsibility, NRCVEE associated faculty and the PhD students initiated various non-funded studies on the effect of Yoga and Ayurveda on COVID 19 related issues during the past year. The findings of the research have been published as well as have been widely covered by the print and mass media.
